Tools|JSLint/JSHint|JSLint is a JavaScript program that looks for problems in JavaScript programs. It is a code quality tool. JSLint takes a JavaScript source and scans it. If it finds a problem, it returns a message describing the problem and an approximate location within the source. The problem is not necessarily a syntax error, although it often is. JSLint looks at some style conventions as well as structural problems. It does not prove that your program is correct. It just provides another set of eyes to help spot problems. JSLint can operate on JavaScript source or JSON text.|Open Source||50000|||||Fleet,GEC|Adopt||2014/12/04||2014/01/01|Chris Thorne created a JavaScript code coverage template using JSLint, Jasmine, and Karma.
